Hello! Vlad Korolev here.
Worked for more than 15 years in systems administration and now I want to move forward and create, software developement is the answer.
Though I studied other languages like turbo pascal and c/c++, for me python is the best way to express your thoughts and ideas.
And json is the best way to commumicate with large language models :)

Worked with Python, various libraries, and frameworks such as Django and DRF, with databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL) and APIs (REST API, Ollama API, Telegram API, Yandex API, SearXNG search API, and others).  
Familiar with Docker, Git, Nginx, Postman, and GitHub Actions CI/CD.  
Repositories for the mentioned projects are available at:  

### Project 'SearchBuddy'  
This project is a Telegram bot that allows communication with users in different languages and can search for up-to-date information on the web when the bot, using natural language processing (NLP), realizes it lacks the necessary data. Additionally, the bot can perform deep searches and analyze articles, providing users with a report on the completed research task (similar to deepsearch).  
**Tech Stack:** Python, python-telegram-bot, Ollama API, FPDF, Requests, SearXNG search API.  

### Project 'TestBot'  
This project is a Telegram bot designed for testing students and distributing educational materials. It supports multiple instructors through the Telegram interface. Instructors can receive student results in the form of report files. The project is deployed in a container.  
**Tech Stack:** Python, python-telegram-bot, Docker.  

### Social Network Project for Recipe Sharing, Subscriptions, and Favorites  
This project features automated image building and deployment.  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Django, Django DRF, PostgreSQL, Gunicorn, Nginx, GitHub Actions, Djoser, JWT Token.  

### Project 'VPS Buddy'  
This is a Telegram bot that assists users with technical questions related to Linux server administration. Using natural language processing (NLP), it understands when a user wants the bot to connect to a virtual machine or remote server and execute commands specified in natural language. For example, the message "install nginx" will prompt the bot to connect via SSH to a remote server and install the required service.  
**Tech Stack:** Python, python-telegram-bot, Ollama API, Paramiko.  

### Online Notebook Project Based on the Django Framework  
Implemented in containers.  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Django, Django DRF, PostgreSQL, Gunicorn, Nginx, GitHub Actions.  

### Automated Utility for Codebase Collection, README.md Generation, and Docstring Creation  
Designed for small Python projects, this utility uses Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to safely add documentation to code, ensuring its integrity.  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Ollama API, AST.  

### Social Network Project with Token Authentication for Sharing Pet Information  
Implemented in containers with automated image building and deployment.  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Django, Django DRF, PostgreSQL, Gunicorn, Nginx, GitHub Actions, Djoser, JWT Token.
