Hello! Vlad Korolev here.
Worked for more than 15 years in systems administration and now I want to move forward and create, where software developement is the answer.
Though I studied other languages like turbo pascal(back in 99-2000) and c/c++, for me python is the best way to express your thoughts and ideas.
And json is the best way to commumicate with large language models :)

Worked with Python, various libraries, and frameworks such as Django and DRF, with databases (SQLite, PostgreSQL) and APIs (REST API, Ollama API, Telegram API, Yandex API, SearXNG search API, and others).  
Familiar with Docker, Git, Nginx, Postman, and GitHub Actions CI/CD.
